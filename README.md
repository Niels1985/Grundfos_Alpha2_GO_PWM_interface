# Grundfos_Alpha2_GO_PWM_interface
Arduino IDE sketch for ATtiny85 microcontroller. When pin 7 (PB2) is high a PWM from 11% tot 84% is on pin 6 (PB1). Pin 3 (PB4) is analog in for potentiometer to set the PWM from 11% to 84%. When digital in is off then 97% PWM is send. (97% = pump off)(11% to 84% = pump minimum rpm to pum maximum rpm).
